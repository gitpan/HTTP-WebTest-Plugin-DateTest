DateTest version 1.00
=====================

ABSTRACT

DateTest is a plugin module for the HTTP::WebTest 
suite. This plugin provides tests for the "age" of 
embedded date strings in the response body of a
HTTP request (typically a webpage).

Limited support is available for international
languages, as long as a Date::Format module
for this language exists (part of DateTime) and
the notational convention doesn't differ too much
from English conventions.

More detail is available from the module's documentation:

  perldoc HTTP::WebTest::Plugin::DateTest

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the following other modules and libraries:

  HTTP::WebTest (version 2.00 or newer)
  DateTime (version 1.13 or newer recommended)

BUGS

Many potentially. Note that the ability to parse a 
date string correctly is entirely dependent on
Date::Parse for English language strings.

Internationalization support is far more limited.
